## 📊 Key Highlights for Resume

**Copy-paste ready:**

```
Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation
Dec 2024 - Jan 2025 | github.com/Adithya191101/hugging-face_So101

Implemented ACT and SmolVLA models for robotic manipulation, achieving 80% success rate on
pick-and-place tasks. Debugged critical deployment failures through systematic root cause analysis:
• Identified language instruction mismatch (0% → 33% success improvement)
• Diagnosed camera configuration swap causing spatial reasoning failures
• Optimized training to prevent overfitting (2.5x faster, better generalization)
• Developed mixed-dataset strategy for visual generalization

Tech: PyTorch, HuggingFace (LeRobot, Transformers), W&B, Google Colab, OpenCV
Skills: Systematic debugging, root cause analysis, quantitative evaluation
```
